Spartan verifier
----------------

An EXPERIMENTAL [Spartan](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/550) verifier, written in
[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/).

Did I say EXPERIMENTAL? Yes I did. Don't use this. DO. NOT. USE. THIS. It's just
for learning how Spartan works (and might not be a correct implementation of
Spartan).
